# ApplePie

This app is a game in which the player has to quess words. Each time the player guesses a letter, the label below the letter buttons updates with the quessed letter. When the letter is in the word to be quessed, the letter displays in the label, otherwise an apple dissapears from the tree, meaning the player has one incorrect guess less. The amount of apples in the tree refer to the amount of incorrect quesses the player has left. When a word is quesses correctly, the "Wins" label is updated with plus 1, and the next word of the list is to be quessed. When all words in the list are guessed, the game stops.

EXTRA:
I added some extra features to the game. In the final app, the words which the player has to guess are chosen randomly from the list of words in the game. In this way, the game has a replay value. Since the list of words is large, a player will not remember all the words and can try to get a better score each time playing the game. Also, I added a label to the view, where the player can see the words he/she has guessed right. When a player hasn't any guesses left or guessed a word right, the next word to be quessed came straight up without showing the player the full word he had guessed. That's changed now.
