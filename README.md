# ApplePie

This app is a game in which the player has to quess words. Each time the player guesses a letter, the label below the letter buttons updates with the quessed letter. When the letter is in the word to be quessed, the letter displays in the label, otherwise an apple dissapears from the tree, meaning the player has one incorrect guess less. The amount of apples in the tree refer to the amount of incorrect quesses the player has left. When a word is quesses correctly, the "Wins" label is updated with plus 1, and the next word of the list is to be quessed. When all words in the list are guessed, the game stops.
